# Udacity_Machine_Learning_Capstone

This Capstone project was conducted under the supervision of Udacity.

The project submission was based on my own idea which is to try to accurately forecast how many hospital beds are required in a new developing area within Australia.

Australia has one of the lowest population densities per land area in the world. With most of the population residing towards the East in cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. 

Because Australia is still rapidly developing, the population needs to “spread out” across the vast land to avoid issues that comes with high population densities. With Australia forecasted to have rapid population growth coupled with the growing trend of urbanisation, the outer suburban population is projected to double or even triple in Australia. Because of this, the healthcare sector needs to predict how many hospitals and hospital beds are required in new developing urban areas.

This project can be interpreted and navigated as follows:

1. Datasets
2. Data Cleaning / Joining
3. Data Exploring
4. Creating a Machine Learning Model
5. Creating a Web App

Which are located in the following areas:

1. `Data`
2. `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`
3. `EDA.ipynb`
4. `ML.ipynb`
5. `ML_App.py`
